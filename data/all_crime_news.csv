"Body found with shotgun, cartridges in Munshiganj","Police last night recovered a body from a road in Talgachhtola area under Mollakandi union in Munshiganj Sadar upazila.

The deceased was identified as Sana Majhi, 42, of the same area. The body was recovered around 11:30pm last night, Munshiganj Sadar police said in a press release this morning.

According to the press release, based on information that locals had caught an armed robber, police rushed to the location and found Sana Majhi's body lying on the road. They found a single-barrel shotgun and two cartridges there.

The release stated that locals beat the man to death and left the body on the road at Moddho Makhati and the shotgun and the cartridges were with the alleged victim.

The body was sent to Munshiganj General Hospital for an autopsy, and a case is currently being processed.

Saiful Alam, officer-in-charge (OC) of Munshiganj Sadar Police Station, said that preliminary investigations suggest that the incident was not a case of robbery. The victim, Sana Majhi, has eight brothers, all of whom are affiliated with the Awami League and politically active for former Munshiganj-3 lawmaker Mrinal Kanti Das.

The victim's brother, Habu Majhi, filed a complaint with the police station alleging that Sana Majhi was killed following a long-standing enmity. After August 5, Sana Majhi and his family left their own place and had been living in a rented house in Dagra Para of Bajrayogini union. On the day of the incident, around 3:00pm, a youth named Swadhin, known to the victim, called him out. And since then, he had been missing until his body was recovered.

OC Saiful Alam further said, ""The victim's family had a long-standing conflict with the family of Babu Majhi from Moddho Makohati Majhibari. In fact, all eight brothers of Sana Majhi were once accused in the murder case of Babu Majhi's brother Shipon Majhi, but later they were all acquitted.""",2025-05-02 15:03:02+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/body-found-shotgun-cartridges-munshiganj-3885171

Clashes break out between SAD groups at NCP rally,"4 hurt, one of them stabbed

Clashes broke out between members of the Students Against Discrimination at a National Citizen Party rally in Bogura yesterday, leaving at least four people injured.

One of the injured was stabbed.

The incident occurred around 4:30pm near the Titu Auditorium in Bogura town.

The injured are having treatment at Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital.

The four injured are Riad Hasan, 21, joint convener of district unit of SAD; Junayed, 21, an organiser; and its members Touhid, 19, and Tahmid Hossain, 25.

Junayed was stabbed.

Speaking to The Daily Star from the hospital, Junayed said, ""The NCP organised a programme demanding a ban on the Awami League, but they included activists from Chhatra League and Jamaat. We went to Sarjis Alam to raise the issue, but the NCP leaders and activists beat us, threw us out of the programme, and also stabbed me. Many of us were beaten.""

In response, Sakib Mahadi, one of the organisers of the event and joint chief organiser (northern districts) of the NCP, claimed, ""A faction of the Students Against Discrimination came to disrupt our event while Sarjis Alam was delivering his speech. An altercation followed. No one was stabbed.""

Contacted, SM Moin Uddin, officer-in-charge of Bogura Sadar Police Station, said, ""A group of 10 to 15 people arrived at the event chanting slogans, and the organisers removed them from the venue. Later, a chase and counter-chase took place on the street.

""We later learnt that some of them were injured and admitted to the hospital. No formal complaint has been filed so far. If a complaint is submitted, we will take action.""

Earlier, Sarjis , chief organiser (Northern Region) of NCP, alleged that Bogura had been deprived for the past 16 years ""solely due to its name"".

Sarjis asserted that Ha1sina and Awami League cannot conduct any political activities in Bangladesh.

He said development projects in Bogura were neglected and the international stadium there was closed.",2025-05-01 01:16:11+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/clashes-break-out-between-sad-groups-ncp-rally-3884246
"Bashundhara chair, family: Freeze 70 bank accounts, shares in 22 companies","Dhaka court orders authorities

A Dhaka court yesterday ordered the relevant authorities to freeze 70 bank accounts of Bashundhara Group Chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan Shah Alam and seven of his family members, including his son and Group Managing Director Sayem Sobhan Anvir, in connection with corruption allegations.

According to an application by the Anti-Corruption Commission placed before the court, Shah Alam and his seven family members had deposited Tk 2,075.40 crore and $1,92,034 in these accounts, where the current balance is Tk 19.81 crore and $10,538.

The other family members whose bank accounts were ordered to be frozen are Shah Alam's sons Sadat Sobhan, Shafiat Sobhan and Safwan Sobhan; Sadat's wife Sonia Ferdowshi Sobhan; Anvir's wife Sabrina Sobhan; and Safwan's wife Yeasha Sobhan, according to the ACC filings.

The court also ordered to freeze more than 75.46 crore shares in 22 companies whose market value stands at over Tk 1458.75 crore, as per the ACC application.

The shares are held in the name of the Bashundhara Group chairman, his wife Afroza Begum as well as four sons and three daughters-in-laws mentioned above.

Judge Md Zakir Hossain of the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court of Dhaka passed the order following an application by ACC Assistant Director Md Sajid-Ur-Roman, who is heading the inquiry, said Aktarul Islam, the public relations officer of the ACC.

The ACC application said, ""Shah Alam and his seven family members, along with their associates and related entities, have invested large sums of money in Slovakia and Cyprus without obtaining permission from Bangladesh Bank or complying with the laws of Bangladesh, in order to acquire foreign citizenship through investment.

""We have information that they acquired foreign passports and invested significant amounts in multiple companies or business ventures in Slovakia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom, and Singapore, and deposited money in Habib Bank Ltd in the United Arab Emirates, conducted large financial transactions with Eurobank in Cyprus, and purchased house properties in Cyprus. These assets were acquired outside Bangladesh without the approval of the government of Bangladesh.""

The ACC filings also alleged that ""despite being Bangladeshi citizens, they invested large amounts of money to obtain foreign passports and citizenship"".

The application states, ""According to the Bangladesh laws, prior approval from Bangladesh Bank is required to transfer capital from Bangladesh to foreign countries. In this case, it has been learned that the persons facing the allegations did not obtain prior approval from Bangladesh Bank before transferring capital overseas.

""They concealed information regarding their overseas assets and did not disclose those in their tax returns. In other words, they unlawfully transferred money abroad without government approval.""

The ACC further submitted, ""They laundered money from Bangladesh by illegally transferring, converting, and layering funds to acquire assets in Slovakia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and Cyprus.

""In addition, they opened accounts in various foreign banks under personal and business names and conducted illegal financial transactions through these accounts. Furthermore, investigations have revealed that they have also acquired huge properties within Bangladesh using illegally obtained funds.""

According to the ACC, Shah Alam and his family members have been attempting to transfer money and shares elsewhere. ""If they do it, inquiry into the allegations brought against them might be hampered. So, an order is needed to prevent them from doing so.""

They laundered money from Bangladesh by illegally transferring, converting, and layering funds to acquire assets in Slovakia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the UK, the UAE, Singapore, and Cyprus. -- According to ACC

The Daily Star contacted MM Jasim Uddin, chief operating officer of Bashundhara Group's brand and marketing, by phone last night for comments and he asked us to send the questions in writing. We sent the questions in WhatsApp, but he did not respond as of filing this report at 1:00am today.

On November 21 last year, the same court ordered a freeze on the alleged foreign assets of Shah Alam and his eight family members in six countries and two offshore jurisdictions.

These assets include bank accounts, real estate, and business holdings.

The order had come in relation to an ACC application that said Shah Alam and his family allegedly amassed huge wealth beyond their disclosed sources of income through illicit means and subsequently, laundered money to various locations, including the United Arab Emirates, Slovakia, St Kitts and Nevis, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Cyprus.

On October 6 last year, Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) asked banks to freeze all personal accounts of the Bashundhara Group chairman and his family members.

About two weeks later on October 21, the same court issued a travel ban on Akbar Sobhan and eight members of his family in connection with corruption allegations.",2025-05-01 00:02:45+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/bashundhara-chair-family-freeze-70-bank-accounts-shares-22-companies-3884346
"4 arrested, sent to jail in Tk 98 lakh robbery case in Gazipur","The Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) in Gazipur has sent four four individuals to jail today in connection with the robbery of Tk 98 lakh from the vault of a cash distributor for an mobile financial service (MFS).

PBI Admin Inspector Mostafizur Rahman Ansari confirmed the matter to The Daily Star at 11:00am.

The arrestees are Abdur Rahman Rajan (28), Rabiul Islam (30), Ujjal (36), and Miraj (25), confirmed Gazipur PBI Superintendent of Police Abul Kalam Azad this morning.

The robbery took place on April 14 around 6:00pm at the office of Multi Point BD, a cash distribution firm located on the 6th floor of Riaz Tower in the Outpara area of Gazipur.

According to Sub-Inspector Bishwajit Biswas, the investigation officer of the case, four unidentified men entered the office posing as DB police.

World press freedom day: 266 journalists face criminal cases so far,"The cases have been filed after August 5 last year

The repression of journalists has taken a new form after August 5, 2024.

Fears for physical safety and instances of judicial harassment are still profoundly visible -- only the actors have changed.

The ghosts of the Digital Security Act hounding journalists have been replaced by more sinister murder and assault charges. Many are bearing the brunt of retaliation for the Awami League government's brutal response to the student-led July uprising.

Over the past few months, as journalists have been booked left and right in cases related to the deadly violence during the uprising, police sub-inspectors and regular criminal courts must deliberate on a question that even media experts struggle to answer: to what extent can journalism incite murder?

""At the former prime minister's press conference on July 26, some top journalists encouraged her to repress the student movement even harder. It is clear that they were not acting as journalists, but rather as political activists,"" said Kamal Ahmed, a journalist who had headed the Media Reform Commission. By July 26, scores of citizens, including children, had been killed indiscriminately by the law enforcers.

But the answer to whether journalism can be linked to murder becomes more tangled the further one descends the hierarchical ladder, the deeper one goes into the districts and upazilas where local correspondents work under duress.

To get a clear picture, The Daily Star compiled figures from Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and information from the newspaper's own network of local correspondents.

This newspaper has found that at least 266 journalists have been implicated in various cases related to the events of July and August last year.

The highest number of those cases has been filed in Dhaka -- 88. Sylhet and Chattogram come second and third, respectively, with 39 and 36 journalists prosecuted.

Savar, Narayanganj, Kushtia, Brahmanbaria and Bogura saw between 10 and 20 journalists prosecuted in each of these districts.

The other districts where journalists faced murder charges or cases filed over July-August violence include Cox's Bazar, Khulna, Lakshmipur, Barguna, Narail, Patuakhali, Thakurgaon, Barishal, Munshiganj, Bagerhat, Jashore, Pirojpur and Netrakona.

Nearly 50 media organisations, from top national newspapers and television stations to local publications, have been impacted by these cases.

The Daily Star also attempted to find overt political links that the journalists might have had with the Awami League, which could suggest that they may have been targeted with cases for reasons other than journalism.

There were a few clear-cut cases. For example, in Narayanganj, two district correspondents were spotted in videos accompanying deposed lawmaker Shamim Osman during a rally where his followers fired on student protesters. One of the journalists was seen in a video carrying a firearm in each hand as the violence ensued.

But overall, only 18 percent of the journalists prosecuted -- about 50 -- had overt political stripes or benefitted from the AL regime.

The majority were the victims of retaliatory cases.

For example, in Sylhet, Monwar Jahan Chowdhury, a UK expatriate and UK correspondent of Daily Shomoyer Alo, was accused in a case even though he moved to the UK a couple of years ago, reports our correspondent.

Also in Sylhet, Khalilur Rahman, a fellow journalist and former general secretary of Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish, filed a case with Kotwali Police Station on August 27 last year, naming nine journalists. The case is now under investigation by the Police Bureau of Investigation.

In Brahmanbaria, retaliatory cases were not only filed regarding incidents of the July-August movement but also the protests and clashes surrounding Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Bangladesh on March 26, 2021. A total of 16 journalists face cases in this district, and at least two journalists, working for two national newspapers, have lost their jobs for being accused in the cases.

On November 24, a murder case was filed at the International Crimes Tribunal against 14 journalists, including Dhaka Tribune's Khulna Correspondent Md Hedait Hossain, on allegations that they had electrocuted a boy to death.

The complaint says that Rakibul Hasan, a resident of Paikgachha upazila in Khulna who was involved in the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, was electrocuted while hoisting a flag tied to a bamboo pole during a protest on August 5.

The first information report alleges that the accused intentionally connected live electric wires to bamboo and electric poles on the protest route, which led to Rakibul's electrocution and immediate death.

The journalist, Hedait, had previously been arrested under the Digital Security Act for his reporting during the December 30, 2018, national election and battled the case for two years.

""In both regimes, I have become the victim of the abuse of political powers. I was named because I belong to the Federal Union of Journalists. I had contacted the father of Rakibul, and he said that he does not even know about the case. He said that three people came to his house and took his NID, claiming that they would get financial assistance from the government. He told me that he gave his signature to the men on a white paper,"" said Hedait.

He was also named in another ICT complaint filed over a death in Ashulia that happened at the same time as Rakibul's death, even though Hedait is from Khulna. ""Strikingly, both complaints cited the same witness. How can one witness be both at Ashulia and Paikgachha at the same time?"" he questioned.

At least 14 journalists have been arrested at various times, with 13 of them still in jail.

One of them, Monirul Islam, the Kuakata correspondent of GTV, was later released on bail. He explained how the case against him was fabricated.

""I was named in a case filed under the Explosives Act. The incident happened on August 4, when a few local boys allegedly threw cocktails at a shop in Kuakata. I was not even in that location, and I had all the proof. I was in Dhaka. I was so sure that it was a mistake that I went to the court and surrendered, but instead of taking my proof into cognisance, they threw me into jail,"" said Monirul. He spent 16 days behind bars.

Monirul is afraid of being too vocal about the case, fearing further persecution. ""I need to stay in my district, because if I cannot, I will lose my job,"" he said.

Former reform commission chief Kamal said one of the reasons that journalists at the local level are being targeted is because many of them have side gigs like businesses. ""Many have multiple identities, and these fake murder charges are a way of score-settling or a result of political rivalry,"" he said.

""These cases need to be independently investigated to find out the underlying reasons behind them, and the police cannot be the ones to do it. But for sure, these reasons are not linked with the offences they are actually being prosecuted for,"" he said.

When asked why murder cases were being filed against journalists, Dhaka Metropolitan Public Prosecutor Omar Faruq Faruqi told The Daily Star, ""They (journalists) might not be directly involved, but they aided and abetted through their speeches.""

The question arises: how many of the prosecuted journalists, especially out of the capital, wielded the clout necessary to incite Awami League cadres or law enforcers to commit murder?

Kamal Ahmed said these cases were unequivocally made on trumped-up charges and that the murder charges were all false.

""There is no specific law in Bangladesh that can prosecute a journalist for incitement of murder through journalism. There are laws that can be used against journalists for breaking down social harmony,"" he said.

In a report in January, Human Rights Watch called the wholesale prosecution of journalists a replication of the ""familiar patterns of abuses from the Hasina administration"".

""While it is critical that those who were involved in commanding, aiding, and abetting the grave crimes committed during the uprising are held to account, mass cases against journalists for not backing the protesters sends a dangerous message for freedom of expression under the interim government,"" the report said.

Beyond judicial harassment, all the journalists The Daily Star spoke to said they were afraid of mob attacks that would ""invariably go unchecked"".

At least 28 journalists were attacked in seven separate instances across Natore, Barishal, Patuakhali, Shariatpur and Dhaka.

Omar Faruk, who had formerly worked at Independent Television, was attacked while covering the demolition of the house of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Dhanmondi 32.

""I went live and was explaining to my audience that the authoritarian rule of Sheikh Hasina had led to intense public outrage. I used the word 'Bangabandhu' to refer to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. After all, even the museum located here was called the Bangabandhu Museum. A mob gathered around me because I used that word, and they beat me up,"" said Faruk.

Faruk said he filed a general diary with the local police station, but there was no update on the investigation.

""I have no hope for justice. Mobs know that they can attack journalists with impunity,"" he said.

Célia Mercier, head of the RSF South Asia Desk, said in a report on February 14 that there was a worrying surge in violence against the media.

She said, ""While the interim government's takeover in August 2024 raised hopes for improvement, journalists' safety remains unprotected. They are being assaulted while reporting, subjected to physical retaliation for their articles, and their newsrooms are being stormed by protesters.

""RSF calls on the authorities to prosecute all those responsible for these attacks, to put an end to this intolerable cycle of violence, and to ensure the safety of media professionals.""

"Court orders confiscation of Joy, Putul, Rehana’s assets","Residential building, a flat, 117 kathas of land to be seized

A Dhaka court yesterday ordered the Anti-Corruption Commission to confiscate a residential building, a flat, and 117 katha of land owned by Sheikh Rehana, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Saima Wazed Putul, Rehana's children Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby and Azmina Siddiq, in connection with corruption allegations brought against them.

Both the building and the flat in question are owned by Putul. They are located in the capital's Baridhara and Gulshan, respectively. The building has a market value of Tk 4.98 crore. Meanwhile, located in Gopalganj and Khulna, the 117 katha of land owned by Rehana, Joy, Bobby, and Azmina are currently worth Tk 1.23 crore.

Judge Md Zakir Hossain of the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court passed the order following an application filed by ACC Deputy Director Md Monirul Islam, who is leading the inquiry, said Md Aktarul Islam, public relations officer of the ACC.

ACC Public Prosecutor Md Rezaul Islam moved the application on behalf of the anti-graft body.

In the application, the ACC states that the order has been sought to prevent the transfer of ownership of the properties allegedly acquired through illegal means.

On April 27, the same court ordered authorities to initiate steps to secure an Interpol arrest warrant against Putul in connection with alleged irregularities in the allocation of plots in Purbachal New Town.

The ACC documents state that Hasina, in collusion with senior Rajuk officials, facilitated the allocation of six plots (each measuring 10 kathas) to herself, her son Joy, daughter Putul, her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, and Rehana's children Bobby and Azmina, in violation of relevant rules.

The ACC filed six separate cases regarding the alleged irregularities involving the allocation of plots in the diplomatic zone of Sector-27 under the Purbachal New Town project.

Earlier, on April 10, 13 and 15, the same court issued arrest warrants against them and several others in six cases filed over plot allocation irregularities.",2025-05-01 00:01:08+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/court-orders-confiscation-joy-putul-rehanas-assets-3884121
Chinmoy Das granted bail,"Former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari yesterday got bail from the High Court after 156 days in jail in a sedition case filed in connection with disrespecting the Bangladesh national flag.

However, Justice Md Rezaul Haque, the chamber judge of the Appellate Division, stayed the bail moments later following a petition moved by additional attorneys general Mohammad Arshadur Rouf and Aneek R Haque on behalf of the state.

Later, the apex court chamber judge withdrew the stay order on a suo moto (voluntary move), Chinmoy's lawyer Apurba Kumar Bhattacharjee told The Daily Star.

The SC chamber judge may hold a hearing on Sunday on the state's petition challenging the HC verdict on bail in presence of the lawyers from both sides, Deputy Attorney General Farid Uddin Khan told The Daily Star.

The HC bench of Justice Md Atoar Rahman and Justice Md Ali Reza granted the bail after a hearing on a rule that earlier asked the state to explain why he should not be granted bail.

Senior lawyers ZI Khan Panna, Prabir Ranjon Halder and Bhattacharjee placed arguments before the HC saying that their client is innocent as there is no specific allegation against him.

The police are yet to submit any report in the case against Chinmoy, who is ill, Bhattacharjee said, adding that there was no element of offence brought against him in the first information report.

Meanwhile, Haque vehemently opposed the bail petition as Chinmoy, born Chandan Kumar Dhar, can interfere in the investigation proceedings if released from jail.

There is also a possibility of Chinmoy fleeing, if released, as he was absconding before arrest, he said.

Additional Attorney General Md Abdul Jabbar Bhuiyan and Deputy Attorney General Farid also appeared for the state during the hearing.

On October 31 last year, Firoz Khan, former general secretary of Chattogram's Mohora ward BNP, filed the case with Kotwali Police Station accusing Chinmoy and 18 others of disrespecting the national flag during a rally six days earlier in the port city's New Market area.

On November 26 last year, a Chattogram court sent Chinmoy to jail, rejecting his bail prayer after he was arrested in the capital the previous day.

When Chinmoy was produced before a court that day, a clash ensued between his followers with the police and lawyers and Saiful Islam Alif, a lawyer, was killed in the melee.

On January 12, Bhattacharjee submitted the bail petition on behalf of Chinmoy before the HC.

The HC bench on February 4 issued the rule asking the state to explain in two weeks why the accused should not be granted bail in the case.",2025-05-01 00:01:03+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/chinmoy-das-granted-bail-3883906

Court orders ACC to confiscate Nasrul Hamid's building in Gulshan,"A Dhaka court today ordered the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to confiscate a building built on a 23-katha plot of land worth about Tk 200 crore in Dhaka's Gulshan which is owned by Nasrul Hamid, former state minister for power and energy, in connection to a case filed over acquiring Tk 36.37 crore illegally.

Judge Md Zakir Hossain of Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court passed the order after ACC Assistant Director Minhaz Bin Islam, who is leading the inquiry team, submitted an application in this regard.

ACC Public Prosecutor Md Rezaul Karim moved the application on behalf of the anti-graft body.

On April 20, the same court ordered the ACC to freeze 70 bank accounts of Nasrul Hamid in connection with same case.

The court also, on that date, ordered confiscation of three cars and four flats owned by Nasrul. The flats are located at the capital's Ramna and Banani areas.

On December 26 last year, the ACC filed three cases against Nasrul Hamid, his wife Seema Hamid, and his son Zarif Hamid for allegedly amassing illegal assets.

In the cases, Nasrul faces charges for acquiring Tk 36.37 crore in illegal assets, while Zarif and Seema are accused of unlawfully holding Tk 20.87 crore and Tk 6.94 crore, respectively.

The investigation revealed that Zarif operated 13 bank accounts where Tk 7.84 crore had been deposited, with Tk 5.82 crore withdrawn. On the other hand, Seema maintained 20 accounts, which saw deposits of Tk 12.78 crore and withdrawals of Tk 11.18 crore.

Shortly after the fall of the Awami League government, law enforcement agencies raided a Banani property owned by Nasrul. The operation yielded Tk 1 crore in cash, a firearm, and 50 rounds of ammunition, fuelling further allegations of financial impropriety.",2025-04-30 19:23:08+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/court-orders-acc-confiscate-nasrul-hamids-building-gulshan-3884096

No cattle market in Meradia ahead of Eid-ul-Azha: HC issues injunction,"With Eid-ul-Azha just around the corner, hundreds of people were seen gathered in close proximity at Golakandail Cattle Market yesterday. According to government instructions, Covid precautions were blasting through the mikes, but hardly any attendant paid attention to the warnings.

The High Court has issued injunction retraining the authorities concerned from setting up a cattle market in Meradia in the capital's Banasree area ahead of the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha.

The court also issued a rule asking the authorities concerned of the Dhaka South City Corporation and the government to explain why the decision for leasing out the Meradia area for cattle market should not be declared illegal.

The HC bench of Justice Kazi Zinat Hoque and Justice Aynun Nahar Siddiqua issued the order and rule on Monday following a writ petition challenging legality of the DSCC's lease notification.

Writ petitioner's lawyer Mohammad Khurram Shah Murad told The Daily Star that no cattle market can be established at Meradia following the HC order.

He said the DSCC published a lease notification on April 21 announcing the decision to set up a cattle market in Meradia.

Challenging this notification, Shahabuddin Shikder, a resident of Banasree, later filed the writ petition with the HC.

Banasree is a residential area, and if a cattle market is set up in Meradia, it will spread throughout the residential neighbourhood.

And this will cause severe suffering for the residents, the lawyer said.

Contacted, Assistant Attorney General JR Khan Robin said the government is yet to decide whether it will move an appeal before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court challenging the HC order of injunction.",2025-04-29 23:54:51+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/no-cattle-market-meradia-ahead-eid-ul-azha-hc-issues-injunction-3883566
17 actors sued for ‘attempt to murder’,"Another actor assaulted, handed over to police

Seventeen actors were sued yesterday in a case filed over the July uprising, while another actor was handed over to police after being assaulted by a group of youths.

The accused include Nusraat Faria, Apu Biswas, Nipun Akter, Ashna Habib Bhabna, Zayed Khan, Suborna Mustafa, Rokeya Prachy, Sohana Saba, Meher Afroz Shaon, Jyotika Jyoti, Symon Sadik and Azizul Hakim.

Filed in March with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court of Dhaka, the case accuses the actors, ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and 265 others of attempted murder.

The complainant, one Enamul Haque, claimed he was injured during student protests in Bhatara last year. After recording his statement, the court directed the officer-in-charge of Bhatara Police Station to register the complaint as a First Information Report.

Sujan Haque, inspector (investigation) of the station, told The Daily Star yesterday, ""We received a copy of the court's order today [yesterday]. Action is being taken accordingly.""

Meanwhile, actor Siddiqur Rahman Siddique was assaulted yesterday afternoon on the capital's Bailey Road by a group of youths who alleged he had ties to the Awami League. The group later handed him over to police.

Siddique, who was in custody at Ramna Police Station, was seen with torn clothes and bruises in a video that went viral on social media. A voice in the video can be heard calling him ""a supporter of the fascist regime"".

In another video, an attacker was heard saying, ""We are Habibullah Bahar [unit of] Chhatra Dal [the student wing of BNP]"".

Siddique had earlier collected a nomination form from the AL to contest the Dhaka-17 by-election in 2023, following the death of actor and MP Akbar Hossain Pathan Farooque, but did not receive the party's nomination.

Talebur Rahman, deputy commissioner (media) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said Siddique was handed over to Gulshan Police Station, where a case had previously been filed against him. He was shown arrested in that case.

Asked about the assault, the DC said, ""We discourage incidents like this. If we receive any specific complaints, we will take action.""",2025-04-30 02:48:10+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/17-actors-sued-attempt-murder-3883241
"SC acquits BNP leader Amanullah Aman, wife in graft case","The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court today acquitted BNP leader Amanullah Aman and his wife Sabera Aman in a corruption case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).

The apex court also scrapped a High Court verdict that had upheld a 13-year prison sentence for Aman and a three-year sentence for Sabera.

A three-member bench, led by Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam, delivered the verdict after hearing an appeal filed by the couple challenging the High Court judgement that had upheld their convictions.

The ACC filed the case on March 6, 2007, accusing the couple of amassing wealth illegally.

On June 21 that year, the couple were sentenced to prison.

On September 10, 2023 a Dhaka court sent Aman to jail rejecting his bail petition after he surrendered before it in the case.

His wife Sabera was sent to prison on September 3 of the same year, after she surrendered before the same court in the case.

July uprising: Rights bodies worried over false cases,"The success of the student-led mass uprising in July-August 2024 marks a decisive break from the trajectory of 'Hasinocratic' authoritarianism. FILE PHOTO: AFP

Human rights organisations yesterday expressed concern over implicating innocent persons in cases filed over the July uprising, saying that such actions, driven by malicious intent or harassment, amount to a violation of human rights.

In separate statements, Human Rights Forum Bangladesh (HRFB), a platform of several rights bodies, and Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK) demanded law enforcers drop the names of innocent persons, including actor Iresh Zaker, from the case filed recently over the killing of a person named Mahfuz Alam Shraban during last year's mass uprising.

Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) demanded that law enforcers stop harassing individuals through politically motivated and indiscriminately filed cases, and instead ensure trial of the actual perpetrators.

""It is essential to ensure justice in the killing of Sharban, and at the same time, necessary and appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that those responsible don't go unpunished. Besides, the government is being urged to take effective steps to prevent anyone from being harassed through cases lodged with with malicious intent,"" HRFB said.

Implicating a large number of people in the cases will hinder both the investigation and the judicial process and delay the investigation reports, it added.

""In this context, it becomes evident that such cases are being filed with the intent to harass, which could have far-reaching consequences,"" it said, while urging utmost caution in accepting such cases.

The HRFB demanded withdrawal of cases, including the one filed against Zaker along with other professionals, non-political individuals, and ordinary people, following proper investigations.

It is also essential to conduct proper probes to identify those involved directly or indirectly in each killing, how they were involved, and under whose instructions these acts were done.

Filing serious charges like murder without any evidence is undoubtedly considered repressive.

""It is also unacceptable,"" the rights body said, adding that the situation is increasingly creating opportunities for both domestic and foreign actors to launch conspiratorial and misleading campaigns against the country's justice system.

The body demanded prompt investigations and trials of the killings of the July uprising as well as an inquiry and action against those who are misusing the law in this manner.

Meanwhile, ASK said the ordinary people have the right to file cases over the murders during the July uprising, but deliberately implicating persons with the intent to harass is a violation of human rights.

The purpose of the law is to protect the rights of citizens. However, the use of law to harass innocent people through such politically motivated cases is unacceptable, it added.

Echoing similar concerns, BLAST said politically motivated cases and mass arrests are undermining justice and called for urgent reforms to ensure fair investigations based on credible evidence. It also urged swift justice for genocide and gross human rights violations during the July-August uprising.

Referring to the murder case of Shrabon where 408 individuals, including Zaker and several journalists, were accused, the rights body criticised the filing of such a first information report without credible evidence or specific links to the incident.

The rights body also warned that similar practices were seen during previous governments, where accountability was lacking, and called for an urgent reform of such procedures.",2025-04-30 00:01:13+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/july-uprising-rights-bodies-worried-over-false-cases-3883401

Former BNP lawmaker Shahrin Islam sent to jail after surrender in two cases,"Shahrin Islam Chowdhury Tuhin, former BNP lawmaker from Nilphamari-1, was sent to jail today after his surrender before two separate Dhaka courts in two cases in which he was sentenced to 21 years in prison.

Shahrin Islam, also a former president of BNP's Nilphamari district unit, was sentenced to eight years imprisonment in a tax evasion case on January 21, 2008. On the other hand, he was sentenced to 13 years in jail on September 11, 2008 in another case filed over amassing wealth illegally and concealing wealth statement to the Anti-Corruption Commission.

CMC student murder: HC asks 12 acquitted accused to surrender in 30 days,"The High Court today ordered 12 individuals, who were previously acquitted in a case filed over the killing of Chittagong Medical College (CMC) student Abidur Rahman Abid 14 years ago to surrender before the lower court concerned within 30 days.

The HC also stayed the trial court verdict that in 2019 acquitted all 12 accused in the case and issued a rule asking the officials concerned of the state to explain why the trial court judgment of acquittal should not be scrapped.

The HC bench of Justice Md Zakir Hossain and Justice Sayed Jahed Mansur issued the order and rule after hearing a revision petition filed by the complainant of the case, seeking necessary directives.

Abid, a third-year Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) student from CMC's 51st batch, was allegedly beaten to death in 2011 for his alleged involvement with Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of the BNP.

The accused were reportedly leaders and activists of the then Chhatra League.

The revision petition was filed by Abid's uncle, Neyamat Ullah, who had lodged the murder case with Panchlaish Police Station.

Initially, 22 individuals were made accused in the murder case. However, police pressed charges against 12 after investigation.

On July 10, 2019, the Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court in Chattogram acquitted all the accused.

The 12 accused now ordered to surrender are: former CMC's central student union vice president Mofizur Rahman Jumma, CMC unit BCL president Sohel Parvez Sumon, general secretary Bijoy Sarkar, joint secretary Himel Chakma, Ferdous Rasel, Shanto Debnath, Mahafuzur Rahman Dhiman, Nasir Uddin Patuwari, Debashish Chakraborty, Mostafa Kamal, Rashedur Reza Sani and Salman Mahmud Rafsan.

Following Abid's death, students of CMC staged protests on campus, prompting the college administration to close the institution indefinitely and suspend all student union and political activities.

Abid's family alleged that Abid had been beaten multiple times by BCL activists amid tensions surrounding the formation of a Chhatra Dal committee at the college. He died on October 21, 2011, while undergoing medical treatment.

Confirming the HC order, petitioner's lawyer Mohammad Shishir Manir told The Daily Star that that the ruling reflects a move toward justice in a politically sensitive case.

He said the accused persons highly inclined the administration of justice in the subordinate court and obtained the order of acquittal.

Advocate Md Ozi Ullah and Advocate Azim Uddin Patwari also appeared for the petitioner while Deputy Attorney General Md Ershadul Bari Khandakar represented the state during hearing.",2025-04-29 22:04:47+06:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/cmc-student-murder-hc-asks-12-acquitted-accused-surrender-30-days-3883561

Barishal ‘gunfight’: Locals contradict Rab claims,"Victims had no criminal records

Police have not found any prior criminal records of the two students shot in a ""gunfight"" with the Rapid Action Battalion during an anti-narcotics drive in Barishal's Agailjhara upazila on April 21.

One of them, Siam Molla, an 11th-grade student of Karfa Ideal College, was killed while the other, SSC examinee Rakib Molla, was critically injured.

Siam was 17 years old, and Rakib is 18, according to their birth certificates.

Rab-8, however, in the first information report (FIR) filed with Agailjhara Police Station on April 22, claimed both were 20 years old.

Rakib is now undergoing treatment at Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital in Barishal.

We have not yet obtained any information that Siam and Rakib were involved in drug dealings. — Milton Mondal sub-inspector of Agoiljhara Police Station

According to the FIR, the Rab conducted the drive at a graveyard in Dakshin Mollapara village under Ratnapur Union at 5:40pm on a tip-off that some people gathered there to trade drugs.

The Rab said in the FIR that its personnel nabbed Siam and Rakib, and found 393 Yaba pills on them while the other suspects fled the scene.

It said the other suspects returned to help Siam and Rakib when they started shouting during the arrest. The Rab members chased Siam and Rakib after they resisted arrest and ran away. At one stage, Siam and Rakib hit two Rab members with sticks and injured them critically, the FIR said.

It said that when someone from the suspects opened fire, one of the Rab members fired five warning shots in the air, and the suspects fled. The Rab said it rescued the two injured members and later heard that Siam died at Gournadi Health Complex after being critically injured.

Based on the FIR, the Rab filed a case against the duo and 10 to 15 others on drug-related charges. Another case was filed against the fugitive suspects on charges of obstruction of government duties and murder.

FIR WITNESS 'WAS NOT ON SPOT'

The FIR stated that a witness named Sukdeb Baroi, a local union council member, was present on the spot when the Rab searched Siam and Rakib.

When contacted last night, Sukdeb said that he had witnessed no such thing.

""I have not seen the boys, or the dead body. I was not on the spot in the evening, when this incident was said to have occurred. I was called around 11:00pm at night because I am the union parishad member. When I reached there, I only saw shoes lying about,"" said Sukdeb.

He said that he does not even know Siam and Rakib, and he agreed to be a witness because he was asked.

WHAT LOCALS SAY

Conversations with over two dozen locals during a visit to the spot on April 26 revealed that the area where the drive was conducted is known as a drug spot.

Locals, however, said they had not seen Siam or Rakib engaging in any drug-related activities.

Titu Hawlader, who lives near the graveyard, told this newspaper that on the day of the incident, a group led by a local man with reported links to drug-related activities arrived at the graveyard before Maghrib prayers.

Siam and Rakib were chatting at a nearby shop, Titu said.

At the time, some plainclothes Rab personnel surrounded the spot, but the local man leading the group at the graveyard started shouting ""robber, robber"", Titu said.

""Siam and Rakib, along with eight to 10 other people, rushed to the scene after hearing the shouts. The locals then got engaged in a scuffle with the Rab members in plainclothes,"" he said.

Titu's wife Mitu Akter said at one point during the scuffle, the Rab members opened fire, and the locals fled.

Locals said Rakib fell into a pond but managed to swim ashore after being shot.

They said he was first taken to Gournadi Upazila Health Complex and later transferred to Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital, where he underwent surgery at 11:00pm on the same day.

The hospital's Assistant Surgeon Akram Hossain said Rakib was shot in the abdomen.

Meanwhile, according to a death certificate obtained from Gournadi Health Complex, Siam was declared dead on arrival around 6:30pm that day.

Family members described Siam as a quiet student who spent most of his time at home or studying. ""Siam had no involvement with drugs or crimes. He was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" said his cousin Mim Akter.

Rakib's sister-in-law Nasrin Begum echoed similar sentiments, saying, ""Doctors have forbidden him from talking, but it's clear from the circumstances that he was not involved in any wrongdoing.""

The locals demonstrated in front of Saheberhat Secondary School on April 23 against the killing of Siam. ""We want justice,"" said his cousin Mim.

WHAT POLICE SAY

Sub-Inspector (SI) Milton Mondal of Agailjhara Police Station, who is investigating the drug recovery case, told The Daily Star, ""We have not yet obtained any information that Siam and Rakib were involved in drug dealings.""

Milton also said that they did not find any evidence that Siam and Rakib used firearms. ""But our investigation is underway,"" he added.

SI Abbas Uddin of the police station, who is investigating the other case, told this newspaper that no prior criminal records were found on the two students.

Oliul Islam, officer-in-charge of Agailjhara Police Station, said the Rab had not informed the police about the drive beforehand.

""We had no prior knowledge about Rab's raid,"" he said.

Contacted, Senior Warrant Officer Sheikh Riazul Islam of Rab-8, also the complainant of the case, declined to comment on a matter under investigation. He suggested contacting higher authorities for queries.

Rab-8 Deputy Commander Major Mahmudul Ahsan told The Daily Star, ""An investigation is ongoing.
